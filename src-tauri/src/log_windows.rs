//! Log windows (`logs-N`) and the app windows that opened them.
//!
//! [`LogWindows`] holds the pairing behind one lock: each app window's current
//! page and the channel it subscribed with, and each log window's entry. Every frame
//! is sent under that lock, with the change it reports. Its transitions return
//! what the wiring does next, and the wiring builds, surfaces and destroys
//! windows after the lock is released.
//!
//! Every lookup starts from the caller's label, read off its `Webview`, so a
//! log window reaches its own app window and an app window its own log
//! windows. An app window's call also names its page, which ends when the
//! window is destroyed or its page reloads, so a request from a page that is
//! gone is refused. A build that page started is still the window's: it
//! finishes, and the next page hears `opened`.
//!
//! The host destroys the log windows it closes, never `close()`s them: a page
//! may cancel a close, and a log window must not outlive its app window.
