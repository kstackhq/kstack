// Package workqueue queues keyed work: Add names a key, and Next hands it to exactly one worker.
//
// **It is not a bus.** A bus fans out — every receiver gets a copy of every send. The three
// differences are each load-bearing for work:
//
//   - A key reaches one worker and no other, which is what makes it safe to drain a queue with
//     several.
//   - Queued work is never lost to timing. It lives in the queue, so a key added before any
//     worker runs is still waiting when one arrives; a bus drops a send nobody is receiving.
//   - A key waits once, however many times it is added, so a burst of adds asks for one pass.
//
// Add queues a held key afresh when the worker reports Done, so work arriving mid-pass is
// never folded into a pass that could not have seen it. AddIfAbsent leaves queued and held
// keys alone; callers deriving work from state must recheck that state after Done.

// Queue hands each added key to exactly one worker. Producers call Add; each worker goroutine
// loops on Next and calls Done for every key it takes.

// early defers the call.
