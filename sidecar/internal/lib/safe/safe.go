// Package safe renders an error for a log line or a stored message, and redacts a
// command's output before the model reads it.
//
// Three callers, for the three places text ends up. Logs go through logging's handler,
// which renders every record whoever wrote it, so an ordinary slog call needs nothing here.
// A message that is persisted instead — a condition served to the UI — has no such sink, so
// it is rendered where it is recorded. A bash result goes through Redact alone, cut by its
// caller's own budget afterwards, and a KubeQuery cell holding JSON through RedactJSON,
// which runs Redact over each of its strings.
//
// Redaction is hygiene against accidental spillage, never a boundary. The rules cover the
// shapes real tools print — an echoed header, a kubeconfig, an env dump, ps, a .netrc —
// and a command can always re-encode its output past any rule (`… | base64`), which is why
// the bash tool's boundary is the user's approval of the command, not this package. The
// residual that follows is stated in the security model's redaction row: a printed form
// interrupted before its closing delimiter — by the capture limit, a kill, or a value's
// own blanks or newlines — can leak past its first token. A new instance of that class
// belongs to the stated residual; it is not a defect in a rule.
