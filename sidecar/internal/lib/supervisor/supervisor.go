// Package supervisor runs work over a set of subjects: the controller pattern without Kubernetes
// — a work queue, a level-triggered pass, and a schedule derived from recorded state. Nothing here
// knows what a subject is beyond its name.
//
// It runs two kinds of thing, and the difference is what a Run's return means.
//
//   - A JOB runs, returns, and is quiet until it is due again. Its lifetime is the call, its
//     Commit is buffered and applied with its verdict, and its whole run is bounded by a timeout.
//     A probe or a sweep.
//   - A WORKER starts, blocks until it is stopped or it dies, and reports while it runs. Its
//     lifetime is the supervisor's, its Commit is applied at once, and its Ready says the
//     starting phase is over. A watch stream.
//
// The rule of thumb: work with a natural end is a job; work that would need a goroutine outliving
// the call is a worker.
//
// A caller registers both under a name — the registration's whole public identity, which the
// edges, Wake, Restart and every read address it by. Add and Remove track subjects; Wake asks for
// another run and Restart stops the current one first; Read and OnPass hand back a Snapshot, every
// registration's observation copied under one lock, which GetJobObservation and
// GetWorkerObservation project by name.
//
// A run's own Result is its schedule — Succeeded waits out the interval, Fail climbs the backoff
// ladder, Suspend and Skip wait for a Wake — so no domain rule lives in the scheduler. What the
// supervisor does with each verdict differs by kind, which due and commit spell out.
//

// the run was stopped, a run that concluded Skip or returned the zero Result, one that panicked,
// and the standing value of a subject dropped by Remove or Close. Nothing else can reach such a
// value to release it.
//
// **A commit is the exception.** The value it replaces is not handed back, because a commit
// often carries the last one's holdings forward — a struct value with one field moved keeps the
// connection inside it — and a hand-back would release what the new value still holds. A run
