// The typed read: a name paired with the value type behind it.
package supervisor

// Key pairs a JOB's registration name with the type it observes, declared once beside the job
// rather than restated at every read. The pairing is checked where the read checks it — when a
// value lands, which in practice is the first test that reads one — and a key declared with the
// same name constant its job registers under cannot get the name half wrong.
//
// A freestanding declaration: registration never hears about it, it works against any Snapshot,
// and a caller that declares none loses nothing.
type Key[T any] struct {
	name string
}

// NewKey pairs name with the value type read through it.
func NewKey[T any](name string) Key[T] { return Key[T]{name: name} }

// Name is the registration name this key addresses.
func (k Key[T]) Name() string { return k.name }

// From is this job's observation out of snap, with the name and type already paired. It panics on
// the same wiring bugs GetJobObservation does.
func (k Key[T]) From(snap Snapshot) JobObservation[T] { return GetJobObservation[T](snap, k.name) }
