// Probe is a repeating notification from a test fake to the test: a callback that
// runs many times calls Fire, and the test takes them one at a time with Await.
// [Signal] is the single-shot counterpart.
//
// Fire never blocks, because a fake that blocks stalls the code under test. That
// makes the buffer lossy, and which value it loses matters: a test almost always
// waits for the NEWEST event ("did it probe again after the poke?"), so Probe
// discards the oldest and keeps the newest. A plain buffered channel with a
// select/default send does the opposite — it drops the value being published,
// which is the one the test is waiting for, and the test times out on an event
// that really happened.
