// Package deltafold is one watch's memory: the records it has sent, by key, and how
// a re-read becomes delta frames. A snapshot is every record as Added and one
// Bookmark; a re-read diffs against what was sent. It knows no record type: the
// caller supplies the key, the equality and the frame.
