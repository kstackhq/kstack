// Package appdb owns <data-dir>/app.db: the only place that opens the file, holding its
// single forward-only migration sequence and handing its pools to consumers.
//
// A SQLite file has ONE schema_migrations sequence, so its schema can't be co-owned by
// packages each embedding their own migrations — a consumer's tables go in the numbered
// files here. Nothing has shipped, so a change edits 0001_init.sql rather than adding a
// file (docs/adr/2026-08-29-schema-edit-not-migration.md). app.db lives outside
// clusters/, which is reserved for the per-cluster cache files (one each, owned by
// internal/clustersvc), so a cache scan never mistakes it for one.
