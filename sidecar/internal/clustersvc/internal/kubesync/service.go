// Package kubesync fills the caches: it discovers what a cluster serves, mirrors every
// served kind into that cluster's kubestore file, and stands behind an answer about each
// one.
//
// It knows nothing about records. It speaks cache ids, kube-contexts, server UIDs and
// GVRs, and clustersvc translates — the layering rule every leaf under it follows. A
// record type reaching this package is an import cycle, which is the enforcement.
//
// Two levels of arming, and they AND rather than nest. TrackDiscovery/ForgetDiscovery say
// whether a cache syncs at all — they also supply the cache, since the connection claim
// and the store claim are taken there — and TrackKind/ForgetKind say which kinds. A
// registration outlives its cache being forgotten, which is what makes a pause one call
// and a resume one call, with no record written and none requeued.
//
// This file is the seam: arming, the gate between its two levels, the reads, the news
// feeds, and the lifecycle.
