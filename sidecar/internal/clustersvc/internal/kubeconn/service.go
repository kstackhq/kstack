// Package kubeconn hands out leases on kube-contexts and reports what probing the server behind
// one found.
//
// The probes live in probe.go and the scheduling around them is the supervisor's
// (internal/supervisor). This file is the rest: leases, publishing what the supervisor observes, and
// retiring the connections its runs build.
//
// Three rules shape it:
//
//   - One context, one entry. Contexts resolving to the same credentials are not merged, so
//     what is learned about one belongs to exactly one context.
//   - A claim outlives what it is a claim on. The kubeconfig can stop naming a context while a
//     holder still holds it, and the entry stays: the file may name it again, and the claim is
//     how the holder hears about that. Only releasing drops an entry.
//   - It never learns what a cluster is. Callers name kube-contexts; whether the server behind
//     one is the cluster the caller meant is the caller's to decide.
