Executes a bash command and returns its output.

- Each command runs in a new process of the user's shell, in `workdir` when given, else the chat's workspace, a directory that keeps its files for the rest of the chat. A `cd` does not carry to the next call: set `workdir` instead of starting a command with `cd`. Shell state (env vars, functions) does not persist; outside the sandbox, the shell is initialized from the user's profile.
- Command output is displayed to you, not reliably to the user.
- `timeout` is in milliseconds: default 120000, max 600000.
- `run_in_background` runs the command detached: it keeps running across turns and re-invokes you when it exits. No `&` needed. Check on it with `Read` on its output file; stop it with `TaskStop`.
- `network` asks the user to give one sandboxed command the internet. Set it only for a command that needs the internet in a chat whose question's context says the sandbox has none.
