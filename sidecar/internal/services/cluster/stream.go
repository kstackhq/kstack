// Stream is what a watch whose source can die returns: the frames, and why they
// stopped. Frames closes on every exit — ctx cancelled, source drained, source
// failed — so Err is the only thing that tells a failure apart from an ordinary
// teardown, and a consumer that ignores it turns a broken watch into a silent one.
//
// The rule is the SOURCE, not the shape: a watch over a fallible upstream returns a
// Stream, gauges included. One that retries forever and has no terminal failure to
// report may stay a plain channel.
//
// **A clean end is a nil Err, and some expected endings are clean.** The cached-data
// watches end that way when their cache is cleared: a user pressing a button is not a
// broken watch, and reporting one would put an error in front of them per open watch. The
// reason the "silent broken watch" argument above does not cover it is that the client's
// reconnect succeeds — there is no invisible retry loop, and the next snapshot is the
// report. Err is for a source that is actually broken.
