-- A cluster's cache: one SQLite file per cluster, owned by kubestore. Every
-- Kubernetes object the cluster serves lands in one table under one shape, with
-- its owner refs and labels as rows a query can join, its events beside it, and
-- the full body kept for deep questions. Timestamps are unix millis.
--
-- auto_vacuum=INCREMENTAL, which the janitor's PRAGMA incremental_vacuum needs to
-- return freed pages to the OS, cannot be set here: it must run before any table
-- exists, the migration runner's own schema_migrations included, and SQLite
-- silently ignores it from inside a migration. It is on the writer pool's DSN
-- (sqlitemigrate.OpenPool).

-- cluster_meta: a key/value bag for sync bookkeeping (a kind's last LIST
-- resourceVersion and when it ran), so new metadata needs no migration.
-- WITHOUT ROWID because the row is barely more than its key, which a rowid table
-- would store a second time in an autoindex; nothing indexes it, so no index grows
-- to pay the saving back.
CREATE TABLE cluster_meta (
    key   TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    value TEXT NOT NULL
) STRICT, WITHOUT ROWID;

-- seq is the file's write counter, seeded here so nothing initializes it at open.
-- Every write transaction takes the next number and stamps what it writes with it.
INSERT INTO cluster_meta (key, value) VALUES ('seq', '0');

-- objects: one row per Kubernetes object, built-in or CRD — the one entry point for
-- "any object".
--
-- created_at is the object's creationTimestamp; updated_at is the last sync write.
-- write_seq is the position of the last write that changed the object, off the
-- file's counter: it moves only when resource_version does, so a relist that
-- rewrites a kind unchanged leaves every stamp alone. changed_at is that write's
-- time, moving under the same rule; the first list counts as a change, so an object
-- unchanged since the mirror first listed it reads that list's time. A delete takes the row with
-- it; the deletes table keeps the uid.
--
-- status_summary, ready_count, total_count, restart_count and host are cross-kind
-- readings objectsync materializes at write time (its status.go) so the cache is
-- queryable in SQL — "which pods in this namespace are not ready" — without
-- unpacking a body per row. They are not what the dashboard renders: the webview
-- derives its cells from raw_json, which is why the body is served verbatim. Each
-- is nullable, and a kind with no meaningful reading stores NULL rather than a zero
-- that would read as "none ready". Per kind:
--
--   Pod         status: phase or container state ("Running",
--                       "CrashLoopBackOff", "ImagePullBackOff")
--               ready/total: ready vs total containers
--               restart_count: sum across containers
--               host: spec.nodeName
--   Deployment  status: "Available 3/3" / "Progressing 1/3"
--               ready/total: readyReplicas / replicas
--   StatefulSet same as Deployment
--   DaemonSet   ready/total: numberReady / desiredNumberScheduled
--   ReplicaSet  ready/total: readyReplicas / replicas
--   Node        status: "Ready" / "NotReady (DiskPressure)"
--               ready: 1 if Ready=True else 0
--   Service     status: type + cluster_ip
--   PVC         status: phase ("Bound" / "Pending")
--               ready: 1 if Bound else 0
--   Job         status: condition summary
--               ready: 1 if Complete else 0
--   CronJob     status: "<n> active, last run <when>"
--   CRD         status: best-effort from .status.conditions[].type/status
--
-- raw_json is the full object, zlib-compressed (kubestore's compressRaw /
-- decompressRaw), so a BLOB. The format is self-identifying — a zlib stream begins
-- with 0x78, plain JSON with '{' — so it carries no version prefix; one can be
-- added without a migration.
--
-- A rowid table, unlike the key-only tables here: WITHOUT ROWID wants small rows,
-- and raw_json sitting in overflow pages the identity read never touches is what
-- keeps the objects watch's per-ping read cheap.
