// Package kubestore is the on-disk cache behind every ClusterCache: one SQLite file
// per cache under the manager's directory, holding the mirrored objects, events, and
// the sync bookkeeping the workers resume from. The schema is
// migrations/0001_init.sql; the per-kind resourceVersion cookie lives in its
// cluster_meta bag rather than a table of its own.
//
// The Manager is the only way to a Store. The kubesync writers and the boundary's
// readers must share one file per cache — the change bus is in-memory state on it —
// and Clear has to close every claim's file before deleting it: deleting under an open
// handle does not fail on POSIX, it silently forks the world, the old handle writing to
// the unlinked inode while a fresh open starts empty. Sequencing that is only possible
// where the claims are held.
