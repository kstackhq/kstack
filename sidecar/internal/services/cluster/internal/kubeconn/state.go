// **The set spans layers on purpose.** A probe dies at the transport, in an API response, or on
// a rule of ours, and a caller asks why once — so a TLS failure and a 403 and a skipped probe
// are one vocabulary. Some names match metav1.StatusReason because that is the same word for
// the same thing, not because this is that set: it has no word for a certificate we rejected.
//
// Assigned when the attempt completes, because the classification is not recoverable later:
// Err arrives wrapped, and does not survive the trip to a caller that only sees a copy.
//
// **Classify from the typed error where there is one.** Dynamic returns *apierrors.StatusError,
// which carries the API's own reason; only the raw endpoints (/readyz, /version) leave a status
// code as the sole evidence. One switch over status codes for both would discard what the typed

// stands. The four probes behind the connection are suspended while it is down, since a server
// nothing reached cannot answer them, and re-armed when it recovers; a probe whose last attempt
// was ReasonUnsupported stays suspended for the life of the connection, because the endpoint is
// absent rather than failing. So "ready, as of 10:00, nothing due" is a state a reader renders,
// not one it treats as stalled.
