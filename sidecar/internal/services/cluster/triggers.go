// Triggers: the bridge from a change feed outside beehive to the records a change
// reaches. Each maps a source's own vocabulary onto beehive names and hands the channel
// to the trigger option declared at registration — beehive owns the receive loop, its
// rate against the store, and its place in the shutdown order. This is the feed half.
//
// Translation is all that is left here, and it is the part beehive cannot do: a source
// of truth is not an object, and only this package knows which record holds the claim
// on the kube-context "prod".
