// Package cluster is the sidecar's Kubernetes boundary: Service and its four
// record families (Clusters, Caches, CachedKinds, CachedData).
//
// This file specifies the whole API — Service and the four family interfaces — and
// bootstraps beehive. One file per family implements it and holds everything else
// about that kind: its beehive shapes, the record served to GraphQL, its delta-watch
// frame, and the controller that writes it. shared.go holds the vocabulary every
// family reuses. Every beehive detail lives behind the Service interface.
//
// Layering: a controller holds policy only, and the mechanisms it drives are leaves
// under internal/ — private to this package by compiler rule. The leaves speak native
// vocabulary (GVRs, a rest.Config, cache rows) and never the records above; the
// controllers translate. A leaf that reaches for one of these types gets an import
// cycle, which is the enforcement. The connection surface is the exception: it reads no
// beehive object, so its types alias straight through and the leaf's exported shape is
// the boundary's. Mechanism growing in a controller instead is the signal to extract
// another leaf: this package's tests stay fast only while the controllers do no I/O of
// their own.
//
// The clusters table in app.db owns a cluster's identity and the user's choices; the
// beehive kinds hold the runtime and their ownership chain:
//
//	Cluster                 (name: the clusters row id; the mirror keeps one per row)
//	    ↓ owns
//	ClusterCache            (name: "{ClusterID}/{serverUID}")
//	    ↓ owns
//	ClusterCachedKind       (name: "cachedkind/{CacheID}/{apiVersion}/{resource}")
//
// A cluster's runtime object is looked up by name, which is its ClusterID; every
// other name is a per-kind reconcile key rather than an identity. The on-disk cache
// is keyed by ObjectID, so a name's arbitrary text never reaches the filesystem.
//
// A kind's GroupKind.Kind string is its Go type name, and both the Kind and the name
// prefixes above are persisted. Renaming one is a store migration the moment anything
// writes.
//
// Cluster carries connection status (Connected, Identified conditions + server/principal
// facts); its ClusterCache child carries sync status, folded per kind from the
// ClusterCachedKind records below it.
