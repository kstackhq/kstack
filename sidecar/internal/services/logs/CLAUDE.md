# internal/services/logs — the log cache, its pages and follows

The service reads container logs through the cluster's connection, keeps them in a file per cache
(`logstore`), and answers pages and follows over the file. A line reaches the model through
`LogsRead`, a `LogsWatch` notice and the View section, all through `logline.ForModel`; the
`LogsView` tool (`internal/tools/CLAUDE.md`) opens a view the user looks at. `README.md` is the
Fetch API's contract for a reader new to it. → [ADR: a rich view
is a tool call's action](../../../../docs/adr/2026-10-18-a-rich-view-is-a-tool-calls-action.md).

The package is layered. Each sub-package is a leaf of the one above it, and none imports `logs`:

| Package | Holds |
| --- | --- |
| `logs` | the service: `service.go`, the scope (`scope.go`) and its resolution (`resolve.go`), pages (`fetch.go`), follows (`follow.go`), the holes a record carries (`gaps.go`); `podsGone` sits with the service |
| `logs/logline` | what a line is: `Record`, its cursor and bounds, cleaning, grep, `ForModel` |
| `logs/refusal` | `Refusal`, `Code` and the one block of codes |
| `logs/iso8601` | a span of time as an ISO 8601 duration: `Parse`, `Span` (a fixed length, under a cap) and `Format`, shared by `graph` and the tools |
| `logs/kubelet` | reading one container's log through the API server: the claim, the read, its windows and limits |
| `logs/logstore` | the file |
| `logs/logstest` | the fake log server the tests read from |

The root `.gitignore` ignores `logs`, so the package has its own exception there.

## The file (`logstore`)

**`services/logs/logstore` is the log cache's file**: one owner-only SQLite database per cluster
cache at `<cache>/logs/<cache id>.db` (schema `migrations/0001_init.sql`: `streams`, `chunks`,
`lines`). → [ADR: the log cache](../../../../docs/adr/2026-10-17-the-log-cache.md).

- `Manager` (`manager.go`) hands out refcounted `Store`s by cache id. An open, close or delete runs
  outside its lock, one at a time per cache. Every operation goes through `Store.use`, and a close
  waits for them. `Clear` deletes the file; `Remove` also refuses the id for the manager's life;
  both still work after `Close`. A delete removes `-wal` and `-shm` first, or a fresh database
  would replay the old WAL.
- `Retention` (`retention.go`) holds every knob. Ids never come back (`AUTOINCREMENT`).
- **Only the page engine stamps a chunk's `read_at_ms`**; tailers and a follow's own walks stamp
  nothing.
  `Store.WriteHeld` holds a follow's gap fill from commit until its walk returns.
- **The janitor** (`janitor.go`) sweeps on `Interval` and past `SweepBytes`: it first retries
  closing the chunks of ended tails whose close failed, then protects open, recently read and held
  chunks, evicts over-share streams first and never-read before read, then removes chunkless
  streams whose pod `PodsGone` says is gone (`service.go`; unset, none), at most `sweepPods` pods
  a sweep, round robin. `Store.Sweep` runs one by hand.
- `statements.go` is the file's `sqlstmt.Set`. **Coverage is a pure function** (`CoverageOf`,
  `coverage.go`). **A `Fill` is one read of one gap** (`fill.go`). **The trim** (`trim.go`) cuts a
  finished stream at the end of `finished_at`'s second (container times are whole seconds).

## The line (`logline`)

- **A `Record` is one line** (`record.go`): its moment, message, `StreamKey`, `Place`, runtime id
  and ordinal, and the `Gap` before it. Every `Record` carries its own cursor (`Cursor()`).
- **A line cursor names a line** (`cursor.go`): moment, container, runtime id, ordinal, as
  versioned JSON in base64url (`Encode`, `Decode`); one with no runtime id is a moment
  (`MomentAt`). A `Bound` is one end of a read's range, a cursor and whether a line at it is in
  range; `StreamPos` reads one as each stream's position. A `Direction` is `Newer` or `Older`.
  → [ADR: a log read is a window over a range](../../../../docs/adr/2026-10-23-a-log-read-is-a-window-over-a-range.md).
- **Every message goes through `KeepColor`** (`clean.go`) before the file and the wire: every control
  dropped but SGR sequences. Grep (`Matches`, over a `CompileGrep` regexp of at most `MaxGrep`
  bytes) and `ForModel` read a stored line through `StripControl`, which drops those too; a
  refusal's message goes through `StripControl` alone.
- **A line reaches the model through `ForModel` alone** (`formodel.go`): stripped again, then
  redacted, at read time. The file and the wire to the viewer keep it unredacted.

## Refusals (`refusal`)

**Every refusal and notice carries a `Code`** from the one block in `refusal.go`, built through
`refusal.New`; the wire and the tools pass it through, read through `refusal.As`, and no layer
derives one from an error's identity. `Refusal` is a value, so no caller can change a sentinel's
words. `Unmirrored` and `NoNodes` wrap one with what the mirror lacked. The sentinels a scope
raises (`ErrNoCache`, `ErrSyncing`, `ErrTooMany`) live in `resolve.go`.

## The kubelet reader (`kubelet`)

- **A container's log is read over a `Claim`** (`claim.go`), one raw `GET` of the `log` path
  through the connection's `HTTPClient`; a cut body answers its reason, never a bare cancel. A
  follow's claim (`Open`) also watches the record and revokes on disable or delete.
- **A read goes through a `Backend`** (`backend.go`) over a `Log`, the container's log as the
  kubelet serves it; `Kubelet` (`kubelet.go`) is the one backend, and `Service.backends` the
  ordered list, a test field. A read takes `Options` and answers a `Read`, its `Item`s in the
  order read (`read.go`). Only the forward read and the first `tailLines` window follow kubetail.
  **A backend writes every line it reads**; the page's test of a line (`pageQuery.keep`: the
  grep inside the range, every line in the padding) only counts what fills a page
  (`filler.pull`, through `Options.Keep`) and decides what a walk passes. **`reader.lines` is the one place a bound is
  applied.** **`FailureKind` is the one classification of a failed read**: fatal (401, revoked)
  fails the page or follow; denied (403) and ended (other <500) end one stream; transient (5xx,
  408, 429, and any error with no status, a transport's included) is skipped by a page and retried
  by a follow; limit (`LoudSecond`, checked first) stops the stream at a second too loud to read.
- **A backward read sizes its windows** (`sizing.go`). → [ADR: backward log reads assume normal
  logs](../../../../docs/adr/2026-10-18-backward-reads-assume-normal-logs.md). Off the log's end it
  reads one `tailLines` window, read whole, then windows of time ending where it began, the first
  sized from that window's rate; under an upper bound, windows of time alone, the first sized from
  the rate of the lines just above the gap (`filler.rateAbove`; ten seconds with none). They start
  at the top of a second, and each is sized to hold about the page's kept lines with half again and
  at most its byte target. A window counts each line as the body carried it, before cleaning
  (`readLine`'s size); a rate from the file estimates that (`WireBytes`). A window checks the rate
  of its newest second as it reads; one due to hold four times the page or four times its byte
  target is stopped (`Item.WindowCut`), left as an island, and replaced (`reader.replace`): from
  the second after its stop, by the one-second window when stopped in its last second or once the
  stream has reached a limit, or halved when stopped in its first, whose second then bounds
  widening until a window from it completes. A window that leaves the read short is followed by an
  older one sized from its own rate, eight times longer after silence.
- **A page reads within limits** (`limits.go`: a `Quota`, and the `Limits` each stream spends).
  16 MiB and 16 GETs a stream, 64 MiB a query (each direction of a page is one), 1 MiB in one
  second. Each stream filled gets an allowance, the smaller of 16 MiB and 64 MiB ÷ streams, which
  it spends until its first window ends; the rest seeds a pool shared by later windows, and what
  is left of an allowance joins it then. A forward read reserves nothing: it spends its allowance,
  then the pool. A later window of time targets a quarter of its stream's share of the pool, the
  pool divided by the streams still reading from it with no reservation out, and reserves four
  times it (`Limits.take`); what it does not use goes back. A reservation is charged, not
  enforced. A fill reads no gap past its stream's bytes or GETs, and gives back what it holds and
  leaves the pool when it ends (`Limits.Ended`). A backward read checks its limits only between
  windows: it is cut once its bytes or GETs are spent or its next target is under 64 KiB
  (`Limits.reached`), and a window begun or replaced past that point is the one-second window; a
  forward read is cut inside its GET, never before its first line in range, and a forward read
  from a second's last nanosecond starts at the next second (`sinceSecond`). **Every cut has an
  edge**: a line, or an empty window's start, a moment (`streamFill.stop`, which the walk stops
  at). A second past 1 MiB, counted as each line's parts are read, is a `LoudSecond`: it stops a
  wider window, and stops the stream from the one-second window, `wholeMoment` or a forward read;
  the page is cut at that second (backward its top, forward its last nanosecond), names the stream
  in a `stream-skipped` notice, and is never refused for it. A follow's fill reads under the
  smaller of 16 MiB and 64 MiB ÷ its streams (`FollowLimits`), reads every second whole and is cut
  only at a second's end.

## The service (`logs`)

**`scope.go` is a read's vocabulary** (`Scope`, what a read covers, with `SourceKind`,
`FilterField`, `MirrorKind`). "View" is the panel the user looks at. `service.go` is `Service`,
built in `app` as `logs.New`, which owns the log store and is the cluster service's
`CacheFileOwner`.

- **A scope resolves inside one `ReadActive`** (`resolve.go`); workloads walk down controller
  references (`podsOf`). With no container named, each pod's default (`containersOf`: the
  `default-container` annotation, else the first, never an init container). A `stream` is named by
  its `StreamKey` and carries its instance's runtime id; it also carries the snapshot its file row
  keeps once the pod is gone, and `stream.log` is what a backend reads. A source with nothing now
  is not refused: it carries a `SourceState` (`Reading`, `Missing`, `Idle`). Refused:
  `Unmirrored`, `NoNodes`, more than `MaxStreams` containers, or a reading cut at its row or byte
  cap. Tests run over `cluster/clustertest`.
- **`Service.Fetch` answers one window query from the file** (`fetch.go`, in sections: the API and
  the page engine, the page cursor, the resolved window, the streams a page reads, the filler, the
  walker, the merge, the caps). A `FetchRequest` is a first page, its `Scope`, its `Window`
  (`Since`/`Until`, inclusive moments, padded `Before`/`After` by lines or a span) and `PageFrom`
  (`PageFromFirst`, `PageFromLast`), or a continuation, a `Cursor`, with `Seen` beside a newer
  one merged into its entries (`mergeSeen`). A first page from either end may send `Seen`, with
  no padding. `PageSize`, `MaxMessageBytes`, `MaxPageBytes` and
  `ForModel` are named on every page; `ForModel` redacts each message through `logline.ForModel`
  before `capMessage` cuts it, so a cut never leaves a fragment of a secret. A `FetchResponse`
  echoes the request as it ran, with `ResolvedAt`, the first page's clock, its records oldest first, its
  `Notices` (never nil), and its place as `Page{Prev, Next, Follow}`. The rules are `Fetch`'s doc
  comment. → [ADR: a log read is a window over a range](../../../../docs/adr/2026-10-23-a-log-read-is-a-window-over-a-range.md).
  **A page cursor holds everything a continuation needs** (`pageCursor`): the scope, the window
  as the first page pinned it (`resolvedWindow`: `ResolvedAt`, `Start`), the way it reads, where
  each stream goes on from (`seen`, one line cursor per container by name: newer cursors, and an older one from a first page's `Seen`, each entry moved to its stream's reach as `edges` writes it), a
  floor for streams with none (`at`), and each counted side's distance; deflated JSON in base64url,
  versioned, never expiring, holding nothing of the file. The service keeps nothing. A first page
  is a cursor from the window's edge (`firstPage`). Going newer each stream goes on from its own
  last line passed (`edges`, from what `walk` reports in `streamReach`), so a late line is on the
  next page; going older one position is exact. A first page whose own edge is a counted padding
  reads that side's padding as a second cursor the other way from the bound (`lookup`), in the
  same `page` call as the range's, and joins the two (`joinReads`); a counted side is trimmed once
  its count is spent (`trim`). `capPage` cuts messages and the page's bytes. `CompileGrep`
  refuses a bad grep, on follows too.
  The far bound is applied in the walk next to the near one (`pageQuery.far`, `clampTo`), and the
  filler clamps each gap's download to the range by passing it in through `kubelet.Options`
  (`fillGap`), so `reader.lines` stays the one place a bound is applied. A newer page in a window
  whose After is counted reads, in the fill and the walk, no more lines past the range's end than
  the count leaves (`pageQuery.full`). A page resolves, files streams, adds gone pods' streams the
  file holds (`pageStreams`), then over those streams (`pageOver`) fills gaps from the backends
  (`filler`), walks (`walker`) and merges (`mergePage`). **A read is written a batch at a time as it arrives** (`window`, `WriteBatch`),
  each batch checked against the mirror first and stamped. A forward read is one window: its first
  batch links down, its last links up only when it read its range whole, and it is cancelled once
  the stream holds the page. A backward read's windows (`Item.WindowEnd`) arrive newest first,
  each oldest first: a window links up only when it completes, and counts toward the page only
  then; one cut part way is an island linked to nothing, and the read's link down is written once
  it ends. `AtEnd` goes only on a completed first window. A backward read is stopped between
  windows (`Options.More`, answered once the window's last batch is written), never inside one. A
  first page's two reads fill the newer first; the older reads back at that read's rate and links
  up to its first line (`streamFill.up`). Each walk reads its share of `maxWalkBudget` (64 MiB)
  plus what its fill downloaded. A page never passes lines a stream did not read: a short stop
  becomes the cut; a short stop with no edge is an internal error in `mergePage`, unless the
  connection's retirement cut it (`errReplaced`). **A change to a read path answers to
  `TestPagesJoinWithoutLossOrRepeat` and `TestTheFileKeepsItsInvariant`** (seeded; fewer seeds
  under `-short`).
- **A read that reaches its backend's beginning never links** (`rotatedAway`, which the filler
  and the tailer share; `reachedBeginning`, `reachedFirst`): a read from a chunk's last line that
  found it rotated away writes an `at_beginning` chunk with no link, so the hole is a lost gap. **A record carries the hole before it** (`Record.Gap`,
  `gaps.go`): every lost gap between two spans that lies between it and its stream's last line
  the view passes; one past a tailer's start once the tailer has committed past it. A walk gives
  a hole between two records to the later; its older edge's record, and a follow's first line on
  a stream, look back past the edge (`looker`, under `Retention.LookBytes`). → [ADR: a head read
  never links](../../../../docs/adr/2026-10-17-a-head-read-never-links.md).
- **`Service.Follow` speaks the page's vocabulary** (`follow.go`, in sections: the follow, the
  tailer, the registry). A `FollowRequest` is a `Scope` and a start: now, `Since` (an inclusive
  moment, as a window's), or `Cursor` (a page's `Next` or `Follow`, whose scope it reads), with
  `Seen` beside either; and `MaxMessageBytes` and `ForModel`, cut through `capMessage` as a
  page's. It answers a `FollowResponse`: the request as it ran, the start's scope and
  `ResolvedAt`, and the `Frames`. Its rules are `Follow`'s doc comment. **Either start is one
  page cursor** (`followStart`): a first page from `Since`, or the cursor with `Seen` merged in and its `Until` and `After` cleared, since a follow
  does not stop. Every stream, at open or joining later, starts at its `keyFor`. A `FollowFrame`
  carries a `Record`, a `Notice` or, last, `Ended`, a `Refusal`. A follow hands out no cursor: a
  caller goes on from its start and the lines it holds, as `Seen`. **A follow whose start is not
  now reads the instances only the file holds first** (`follow.open` files them through
  `fileOnlyStreams`; `readOnly` reads them through `pageOver` with `grepAll`, a page of
  `MaxPageSize` at a time from the start cursor): its streams are keyed by `StreamKey` and cannot
  hold them, and they never grow, so one read is enough. The open defers `NoNodes` as a page does,
  refusing it only with no such instance to read; once they are read, a scope of gone pods alone
  ends with it. A stream `failed` ends on an error says so once a generation, a `stream-skipped`
  notice, unless its container is waiting to start.
- **A follow walks the file from a watermark per stream.** One **tailer** per stream is shared through the file's
  **registry** and outlives its last follow by `TailGrace`. Tailers hand lines to **the file's
  writer** (`logstore/writer.go`) in batches; a tailer the writer cannot take from within
  `WriteWait` closes its chunk and reads from now, or ends with no follow. Every commit pings the
  file's bus (`Store.Subscribe`). A walk crosses a tailer's gap only up to `Tail.Committed`. **A
  walk that meets a live gap starts its fill on a goroutine of its own and stops** (`follow.fill`);
  the fill's end comes back to the follow's loop, which walks the stream on (`filledGap`). Until
  then the stream is `filling`: no walk reads it, its watermark waits at the gap, and the view
  counts it as waiting. Lines are ordered per container only. From now it reads from
  `sinceTime`, never `tailLines=0`.
- **A follow's streams are one reconcile** (`follow.reconcile`), run after every mirror event
  (settled by `followSettle`), node change, stream end or retry. A container is tailed unless it
  ended at the `generation` the view sees now. A dropped container is held for a backoff up to
  `followRetryCap`. A `Pod` source leaves the view once its pod is gone by UID. **An ending the user
  can read is an `Ended` frame, not an error** (any `Refusal`, via `refusal.As`); any other
  ending sets `Err`, and a cancel sets none. **Its caller is the viewer's `logsFollow`.**

## Test fixtures (`logstest`)

`logstest.Server` is the fake log server every read test drives: a log per container, a follow
per request, refusals, rotation and broken bodies, served over HTTP or straight through `Get`.
`Refused` builds the error `Get` answers a refusal with; a `kubelet` test sets it to a
`StatusError`. `LineEvery`, `Tails`, `WideLines`, `LoudLine` and `Stamped` make its lines.
Every read test trusts it, so `server_test.go` pins how it answers each parameter the
kubelet honours; a change to the fake changes that test first.
The fake cluster service stays in `logs`' `testutil_test.go`; `kubelet`'s claim tests carry a
smaller one of their own. A test package keeps its own copies of the few one-line helpers (`at`,
`line`, `lineAt`) rather than importing them.
