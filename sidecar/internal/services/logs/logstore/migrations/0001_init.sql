-- One cluster cache's log lines. Every moment is nanoseconds since the epoch, and NULL
-- is not zero: an unknown time is NULL.

-- streams: one runtime instance of a container. A restart makes a new one, and the
-- old instance's lines stay under the old row. Whether it is the pod's previous instance
-- is read off the pod when a page is read, never stored. The place, the labels and the
-- times are a snapshot from the mirror taken while the pod is still there, since the
-- lines outlive it; they describe the stream and never name it.
--
-- pod_uid is the pod the instance ran in, '' when unknown, which tells a gone pod's
-- streams from a later pod of its name. is_default is 1 for the pod's default
-- container as kubectl picks it, which a view naming no container reads once the pod
-- is gone. container_id is the runtime instance, '' for a backend that knows only the
-- name. started_at is when the instance started, NULL when unknown; finished_at is when
-- it stopped, NULL while it runs. labels is the pod's labels as a JSON object, '{}'
-- when unknown.

-- chunks: the unit of coverage and of eviction. A chunk states a fact: every line the
-- backend served for this stream between its two edges that matches pattern is in lines.
-- Its edges are positions, (from_ns, from_ord) and (to_ns, to_ord), since a chunk closes
-- at a byte budget wherever that falls, inside a moment included.
--
-- prev_ns and prev_ord are the position the chunk continues from: the last line of the
-- chunk before it, with no line between that the origin backend holds. NULL when the
-- chunk opened on a gap. Two chunks so linked are one span of coverage.
--
-- pattern is the grep the fill ran under, '' for every line. origin is the backend that
-- filled it, by name. at_head is 1 when that backend holds nothing older than from_ns;
-- at_end is 1 when to_ns is the last line of a finished instance's log; open is 1 while
-- a tailer is still writing into it. read_at_ms is the last read or write in unix
-- milliseconds: a clock, not a line's moment.
