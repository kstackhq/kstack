// What a window has typed into a chat but not yet delivered: the draft in the box
// and the send in flight, one entry per chat. The entries live above the routes
// because the composer unmounts under them — the first send moves chat mode to the
// new chat's route, and a chat deleted elsewhere takes its pane down — and a send
// must settle into its entry whatever became of the box that started it.
