// A log window's layout, mounted by the pathless `_logs` route: one column the
// window's height bounds, with no sidebars and no dialogs host. The routed page draws
// its own bar, since the bar names what the page reads. The column's height is
// definite and every plain flex item under it takes `min-h-0`, so the viewer scrolls
// and the window never does.
