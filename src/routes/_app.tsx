// Pathless layout route: wraps chat/dashboard in `AppLayout` so they share the
// sidebar (a log window's page nests under `_logs` instead). Owns the
// window's search params — `kubeContext` and the dashboard's `resource` and `chat`
// — and `retainSearchParams` carries them across the mode switch, so coming back to
// the dashboard returns to the resource you left.
